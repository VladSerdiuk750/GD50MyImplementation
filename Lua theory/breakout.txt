love.graphics.newQuad(x, y, width, height, dimensions)
- Specify rectangle boundaries of our Quad and pass in the dimensions
  (returned via image:getDimensions on whichever texture we want to make a
  Quad for).

love.graphics.draw(texture, quad, x, y)
- Variant of love.graphics.draw, which we've seen, but this time we can pass
  in a Quad to draw just the specific part of the texture we want, not the 
  entire thing!
